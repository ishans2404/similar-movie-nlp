**Finding Similar Movies Based on Plot Summaries**

This project explores using NLP to find similar movies based on their plot summaries. We'll use the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition and Exploration:**
    - Import libraries like pandas, NumPy, nltk, and scikit-learn.
    - Load a dataset (movies.csv) containing movie titles, genres, and plot summaries from Wikipedia and IMDB (assuming the data is properly formatted).
    - Examine the data to understand the number of movies, genres, and potential inconsistencies (e.g., missing values).

2. **Preprocessing Movie Plots:**
    - Combine the movie plot summaries from Wikipedia and IMDB into a single 'plot' column.
    - Tokenize the plot summaries: Break down the text into sentences and then words. This allows us to analyze the content.
    - Stemming: Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"). This helps focus on core concepts.
    - Create a function `tokenize_stem` that performs these steps together for efficiency.

3. **Vectorization:**
    - Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the processed plot summaries into numerical vectors.
        - TF-IDF captures the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire dataset. Words that appear frequently in a single document but rarely overall get a higher weight.
    - This allows us to represent movie plots in a way suitable for machine learning algorithms.

4. **Clustering Movie Plots:**
    - Use KMeans clustering to group movies with similar plot summaries into different clusters. The number of clusters (k) is a user-defined hyperparameter. Here, we'll use k=7.
    - Each movie will be assigned a cluster label based on the closest cluster centroid (representative movie plot) in the vector space.

5. **Similarity Calculation:**
    - Employ Cosine Similarity to measure the similarity between movie plots based on their TF-IDF vectors. 
        - Cosine similarity returns a value between 0 (completely dissimilar) and 1 (identical).

6. **Movie Recommendations:**
    - Create a function `find_similar` that takes a movie title and recommends the most similar movie based on cosine similarity. 
    - Iterate through all movies and find similar movies for each one.


**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates the potential of NLP for building movie recommendation systems based on plot summaries. By applying techniques like tokenization, stemming, TF-IDF vectorization, and KMeans clustering, we can find similar movies and suggest content users might enjoy. There's room for further exploration and refinement to create a more comprehensive recommendation system.
